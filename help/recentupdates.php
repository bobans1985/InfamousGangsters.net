<font size=1 color=red face=verdana><b>Steven</b></font> <font size=1 color=white face=verdana>and</font> <font size=1 color=red face=verdana><b>Dispute</b></font> <font size=1 color=white face=verdana>have been working behind the scenes in recent weeks to bring you changes and updates to State Gangsters. The first obvious change is we now have a new layout, however this layout is <b>best viewed on Mozilla Firefox</b> and shown incorrectly on browsers such as Internet Explorer.
<br><br>

<b>Minor updates:</b><br>
- Your Stats; Timers have been set into the rightmenu and now automatically count down<br>
- New Missions<br>
- Profile view counter added to profiles<br>
- Seperate awards for casinos added to profiles (can be turnt on/off on Edit Profile)<br>
- Game records now shows what # you are at whether in top 5 or not<br>
- You can now see your sent mail on your inbox page AND search for a message<br>
- When putting offers up on quicktrade you now put price per point rather than the total price<br>
- Another Super Rare has been put into the game, available to be stolen<br>
- You can now see how many seconds a target / user has left to recover on kill page<br><br>

<b>Major updates:</b><br>
- Game Layout<br>
- Car Garage; This was previously known as the Repair page, this page is now also used when your wanting to sell your cars, as well as repair and drop them<br>
- Organised Assassination; You are now able to select the rank of your target, and each rank has a set reward which you will get for killing it<br>
- Melt; The biggest update of them all, you are now able to melt up to 30 cars at one time, your timer will build up and the price for resetting your timer will increase/decrease to the time you have remaining<br>
- Hitlist; There is now two seperate hitlists, one containing points, the other containing money. You now have the option to choose how you want to hitlist a victim<br>
- Crew Bullets; Bosses now have the option to set a reward for every 1,000 bullets a member melts. The reward will automatically be taken out of the crew bank and will build up if theres not enough in there<br>
